MovieLens is a company in the internet and entertainment domain providing an online database of information related to films, television series, and online streaming content including cast, production crew, trivia, ratings, fan, and critical reviews. Every year in collaboration with a guest curator, MovieLens publish their annual insights based on a theme providing a comprehensive view of a topic.

## Problem Statement
### Overview:
The MovieLens Power BI project aims to analyze and visualize data related to various movies based on genres, age groups of viewers, and occupations of the audience. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into movie preferences and viewing patterns across different demographic segments.
The task is to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides in-depth analysis of movies, focusing on the following aspects:

#### Genre Analysis:
 Explore the distribution of movies across different genres and identify the most popular genres among viewers.

#### Age Group Analysis: 
Investigate the movie preferences of viewers across different age groups. Determine which genres appeal to specific age demographics and analyze viewing trends.

#### Occupational Analysis: 
Examine the movie-watching habits of individuals based on their occupations. Identify if there are any correlations between certain professions and movie preferences.

### Key Objectives:

Data Exploration: Collect and preprocess MovieLens dataset to extract relevant information on movie genres, viewer demographics (age groups), and occupations.

### Visualization:
 Develop interactive visualizations using Power BI to represent the distribution of movies by genre, age group preferences, and occupation-based viewing patterns.

### Genre Insights: 
Provide insights into the popularity of genres among different demographics. Identify any genre preferences specific to certain age groups or occupations.

Audience Segmentation: Segment the audience based on age groups and occupations to uncover patterns in movie preferences. Determine if there are any notable differences in viewing habits across demographic segments.

Recommendations: Based on the analysis, generate recommendations for movie producers and distributors regarding genre selection, marketing strategies, and target audience preferences
